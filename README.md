### Backend Developer | ADS Student | Tech Enthusiast

Hi! My name is **Moisés Aniceto**, I’m 20 years old and I’m from Brasília, Brazil.  
I’m currently studying **Analysis and Systems Development** and specializing in **Backend Development** and **Data**, focusing on building APIs, automations, databases, and data analysis for decision-making.

I also have a strong interest in **Cybersecurity**, learning how to protect applications, data, and systems from vulnerabilities and contributing to more secure and resilient environments.

I have been deepening my technical knowledge through courses in system development, programming logic, Python, C#, and data analysis.

I’m driven by **curiosity**, **continuous improvement**, and the desire to create solutions that deliver real value. I enjoy learning, teaching, and collaborating on projects that challenge my logical thinking, analytical skills, and creativity.
